# 6. Crafting, Gathering, and Professions

## Design Pillars
- Crafting is a parallel progression path, not just endgame padding.
- Professions interlock with economy (auction house, trading) and combat readiness (potions, gear repair).
- Gathering loops should encourage world exploration and social cooperation (parties farm nodes faster, guild quests need specific materials).

## Profession Categories
- **Gathering:** Fishing, Herbalism, Hunting, Mining, Lumberjacking (supports weapon/armor crafting), plus Doctor post-combat care.
- **Production:** Blacksmithing, Tailoring, Alchemy, Cooking, Enchanting, Medical (consumables for trauma healing).
- **Support:** Cartography (reveals hidden nodes), Engineering (siege devices for clan wars).

Each character can master two primary professions and two gathering jobs; reset via expensive questline or premium service.

## Progression & Skills
- Skill points per profession increase through successful crafts/gathers; higher tiers unlock advanced recipes.
- Quality ratings (Common → Legendary) influenced by profession skill, tool quality, buffs, and location bonuses.
- Failure states for risky crafts (enchantments) consume materials but reward small XP to reduce frustration.

## Crafting Stations & Tools
- City-based stations: forge, loom, alchemy lab, infirmary, etc., each with queue limits during peak times.
- Portable kits allow low-tier crafting in the field with penalties (longer time, lower success rate).
- Tools degrade; players craft/repair them, creating a sink for materials.

## Recipes & Resources
- Recipes acquired via quests, drops, vendors, or guild research trees; some bound to guild/clan achievements.
- Gathering nodes: herbs, ore veins, rare fish spots, monster parts; respawn timers vary by biome.
- Premium artifacts require both crafting and premium tokens, ensuring monetization ties to gameplay.

## Integration with Other Systems
- Auction house listings include profession requirements, making it easy to source commissions.
- Guild missions demand bulk crafted goods, driving coordinated profession leveling.
- Doctor profession shortens trauma timers after PvP, incentivizing support roles in clans.
- Crafting achievements feed into titles/housing trophies (see `2_user.md`).

## UI & UX
- Hotwire-driven crafting interface with recipe filters, material availability indicators, and success chance preview.
- Progress bars stream updates via Turbo; players can queue multiple crafts and receive notifications when done.
- Tutorial quests introduce gathering tools, crafting stations, and profession trainers in starter city.
