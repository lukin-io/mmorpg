# 12. Clan & Territory Control

## Purpose
- Enable large-scale alliances for strategic warfare, resource control, and social prestige.
- Provide long-term goals beyond personal progression through territory ownership and clan advancement.

## Clan Structure
- Requirements: level threshold + gold fee + quest to found a clan.
- Roles: leader, officers, warlords, quartermasters, recruiters, members; permissions managed via UI.
- Clan XP/leveling unlocks buffs (crafting speed, resource yield), cosmetic standards, and banner customization.

## Territory & Warfare
- World map divided into controllable regions (cities, castles, resource nodes).
- Scheduled clan wars: attackers declare intent, defenders prepare; battles resolved via PvP instances + support objectives.
- Ownership grants taxes on local trades, access to exclusive dungeons, and fast travel options.

## Clan Economy & Infrastructure
- Shared treasury (gold, silver, premium tokens) with role-based withdrawal limits.
- Clan housing/strongholds upgradeable via crafted materials; upgrades unlock vendors, training dummies, war rooms.
- Research trees requiring bulk crafted items and quests to unlock buffs or recipes for the entire clan.

## Social & Governance
- Application/recruitment pipeline with vetting questions, referrals, and auto-accept rules.
- Clan quests encourage cooperative objectives (defend caravans, craft supplies, clear raids).
- Internal messaging boards and announcement tools; integrations with Discord via webhooks.

## Moderation & Conflict Resolution
- Log all clan transactions, promotions, and war declarations for audit.
- Tools for GMs to mediate disputes, roll back abusive leadership actions, or dissolve inactive clans.
