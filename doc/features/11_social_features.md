# 11. Social Systems & Communication

## Chat & Messaging
- Channel types: global, local/region, guild, clan, party, arena, private whispers.
- Moderation hooks: profanity filter, spam throttling, GM mute/ban commands, inline reporting.
- Persistent mail system for offline messages, item attachments, and system notifications.

## Friends & Presence
- Bidirectional friends list with status (online, busy, AFK), location, and last activity.
- Group finder for parties, guild recruitment, and profession commissions.
- Presence broadcasting via Action Cable to keep chat and guild panels live.

## Guilds & Player Groups
- Guild creation with customizable ranks/permissions, shared bank, bulletin board, level-based perks.
- Party mechanics for exploring, dungeons, and PvP; leader tools for inviting/kicking, ready checks.
- Social hubs in cities (taverns, arenas) with mini-events, NPC facilitators, and notice boards.

## PvP Arenas & Competitions
- Structured duels and tournaments with matchmaking, seeding, and seasonal ladders.
- Spectator mode via read-only Turbo streams; chat overlays for commentary.
- Reward structure: titles, cosmetics, currency payouts tied to placement.

## Reporting & Community Safety
- Inline report buttons on chat lines, player profiles, and combat logs linking to moderation workflow (`5_moderation.md`).
- Opt-in privacy settings (ignore lists, message limits, duel challenge toggles).

## Integrations & Out-of-Game Community
- Webhooks for Discord/Telegram to announce guild achievements, arena winners, seasonal events.
- Future roadmap: forum embedding, screenshot sharing, API for fan sites.
