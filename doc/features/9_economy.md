# 9. Economy & Trading Systems

## Currency Model
- Gold: primary currency earned through quests, combat, trading.
- Silver: secondary currency for low-tier NPC services and starter gear.
- Premium tokens: purchased via real money, used for artifacts, cosmetics, quality-of-life boosts.
- Soft caps and sinks (taxes, repairs, housing upkeep) maintain currency health.

## Trading Mechanics
- Auction House: bidding/buyout, advanced filters (item type, rarity, stat), listing fees as gold sink.
- Direct Player Trades: dual-confirmation UI with anti-scam preview; supports currency + items + premium tokens.
- Marketplace Kiosks: localized trading posts in cities for quick listings with limited duration.

## Crafting & Resource Economy
- Gathering nodes spawn across regions with rarity tiers; contested nodes drive PvP hotspots.
- Crafted goods feed directly into auction house demand (consumables, gear, enchantments).
- Doctor services and infirmary fees consume crafted medical supplies, closing the loop.

## Premium Items & Monetization
- Premium artifacts provide convenience (teleport scrolls, storage, XP boosts) without hard power creep.
- Cosmetic housing decor, mounts, titles purchasable via premium tokens.
- Transparent ledger of premium purchases/refunds (ties into `1_auth.md` + `5_moderation.md`).

## Player-driven Market Controls
- Dynamic tax rates based on city ownership (clan control) encourage political play.
- Anti-inflation levers: daily listing caps per account, progressive taxes on bulk trades, GM interventions logged.

## Economic Data & Analytics
- Track item price history, trade volume, currency velocity; expose to players via in-game charts.
- Flag suspicious patterns (dupe exploits, gold sellers) for moderation alerts.
- Scheduled reports for Live Ops to tune drop rates, crafting costs, and sinks.
