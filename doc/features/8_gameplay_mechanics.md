# 8. Core Gameplay Mechanics

## Player Movement
- Tile-based grid; each turn allows a movement, action, or interaction.
- Movement processed centrally to prevent speed hacks; latency-hidden with predicted UI updates.
- Environmental modifiers (swamps slow, roads speed up) encourage route planning.

## Combat System
- PvE: instanced or overworld encounters vs monsters/NPCs with aggro behavior and loot tables.
- PvP: duels, party skirmishes, arena tournaments, large-scale clan battles; ranking ladders per mode.
- Turn order determined by initiative; abilities consume class resources (rage/mana/energy) and apply buffs/debuffs.
- Combat log records every action for replays, moderation, and player learning.

## Character Progression
- XP gained via quests, combat, gathering; leveling grants stat points (STR, AGI, INT, STA, SPR, etc.).
- Reputation/faction alignment gates access to cities, vendors, and storylines.
- Class-specific skill trees unlock abilities through quests and level milestones; respec via quest or premium item.

## Classes, Skills, Abilities
- Launch classes: Warrior, Mage, Hunter, Priest, Thief—each with distinctive roles.
- Skill trees mix active abilities, passives, and ultimate unlocks; allow hybrid builds for depth.
- Unlockable advanced specializations (e.g., Paladin, Assassin) via epic questlines.

## Items, Inventory, Equipment
- Multi-slot equipment system (weapon, armor pieces, accessories, consumables).
- Inventory weight/slot limits; storage expanders available via housing or premium services.
- Artifacts/premium items sold via real currency but tuned to stay fair; cosmetic focus where possible.
- Enhancement/enchantment mechanics add risk/reward loops; integrates with crafting professions.

## Supporting Systems
- Trauma/healing post-battle managed by doctor profession or city infirmaries.
- Detailed statistics tracking for player profile (damage done, quests completed, arena rating).
- In-game tutorial quests introduce movement, combat, stat allocation, and gear upgrades.
