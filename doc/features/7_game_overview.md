# 7. Game Overview

## Vision & Objectives
- Faithfully recreate the core Neverlands.ru experience with modern UX while honoring nostalgia.
- Foster deep community engagement through shared social hubs, cooperative mechanics, and PvP rivalries.
- Provide a long-term progression loop mixing narrative, PvP ladders, crafting mastery, and seasonal events.

## Target Audience
- Veterans of classic Neverlands seeking an authentic revival.
- Players who enjoy turn-based, tile-based MMORPGs with social depth and tactical combat.
- Community-driven guild/clan organizers, role-players, and competitive arena participants.

## Genre & Tone
- Medieval fantasy MMORPG with turn-based encounter resolution and tile-grid exploration.
- Emphasis on strategic planning, faction politics, and resource control rather than twitch reflexes.

## Platform & Technology
- Browser-first Rails + Hotwire experience with responsive design for desktop and mobile Safari/Chrome.
- Future-proofing for companion apps by leveraging JSON:API endpoints once core gameplay is stable.

## Success Metrics
- Retention: players returning daily for quests, crafting, and social features.
- Community growth: active guilds/clans, forum/Discord engagement, seasonal event participation.
- Monetization balance: premium items enhance, not dominate, gameplay; whales subsidize without pay-to-win.
