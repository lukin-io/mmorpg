# 10. Quests, Narrative, and Events

## Story Structure
- Main storyline mirrors Neverlands canon with sequential chapters unlocked via level/reputation gates.
- Side quests flesh out lore, crafting specializations, faction politics, and hidden areas.
- Branching dialogue choices influence reputation, faction alignment, and future quest availability.

## Quest Types
- Static quests: hand-authored arcs for key NPCs, cities, and dungeons.
- Dynamic quests: system-generated tasks reacting to world state (resource shortages, clan control changes).
- Repeatable dailies/weeklies for consistent rewards and engagement loops.
- Event quests tied to seasonal/holiday content or tournaments.

## Rewards & Progression
- XP, currency, reputation, crafting recipes, cosmetic unlocks, premium token fragments.
- Quest lines unlock class abilities, professions, and housing upgrades.
- Difficulty tiers signal recommended level/party size; fail states feed back into story (e.g., rival gains advantage).

## Quest Delivery & UX
- Quest log with filters (active, completed, repeatable) updated via Turbo streams.
- Map overlays highlight objectives, NPCs, and resource nodes.
- Cutscenes/dialogues rendered inline using Hotwire for low-latency storytelling.

## Events & Special Activities
- Seasonal festivals introduce limited quests, themed rewards, and world reskins.
- Arena tournaments scheduled with brackets, announcer NPCs, spectating support.
- Community competitions (fishing derby, gathering drives) tracked via leaderboards and broadcast announcements.

## Moderation & Tooling
- GM console to spawn/disable quests, adjust timers, and compensate players after bugs.
- Analytics dashboards show quest completion rates, abandon reasons, bottlenecks.
